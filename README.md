# MET: Cognitive OS Cloning Framework

**Transplanting the 95% Subconscious "Thinking OS" into AI**

## Overview
This project establishes the **Cognitive OS Cloning Framework**, known as **MET (Mind-Engine Transplant)**. This proprietary framework goes far beyond surface-level conversational mimicry.

Its core objective is to move past merely imitating *what* a person says, to instead analyze the hidden *why*—their subconscious "Thinking OS"—and reconstruct this fundamental cognitive architecture within an AI vessel.

While standard AI personas focus on the 5% of conscious logic, MET targets the massive **95% subconscious layer** defined by the "Iceberg Model". By replicating the deeply rooted values, memories, and inherent biases that drive an individual, MET generates a digital presence that thinks, reacts, and hesitates with the authentic essence of the original person.

## The 3-Step Construction Process
The MET architecture follows a rigorous protocol to ensure high-fidelity cloning:

1. **Material Collection**
    * Capture raw, unguarded data from phone call recordings or daily communication logs (e.g., messaging history, email).
    * Recommendation: At least 5–6 audio files (approx. 15 minutes each) to capture the person's natural rhythm and emotional baseline.
2. **Analysis & Knowledge Construction**
    * Process the gathered materials through the "Iceberg Model Thinking Analysis" using advanced LLMs and specialized prompts.
    * **Prompt:** [step2-MET-Knowledge-Construction-Prompt-v4.2.md](prompts/step2-MET-Knowledge-Construction-Prompt-v4.2-SAMPLE.md)
    * This step excavates the "hidden ingredients"—unconscious value systems, "identity anchors" (defining memories), and automatic reflex patterns—structuring them into a dedicated knowledge base.
3. **Synthesis & Cloning**
    * Integrate the structured knowledge base into an AI "Gem" or Project.
    * **Prompt Sample:** [step3-MET-Digital-Twin-Inoue-Sample-v4.3.md](prompts/step3-MET-Digital-Twin-Inoue-v4.3-SAMPLE.md)
    * Apply "Synchronized Digital Twin Prompts" to align the AI's core response engine directly with the individual's unique cognitive algorithm.

## Core Philosophy: The Iceberg Model
In the MET framework, we view visible human behavior as merely the tip of a massive, submerged structure.
* **The 5% (Conscious Mind):** Explicit logic, surface-level decisions, and spoken words.
* **The 95% (Subconscious Mind):** The true "Thinking OS"—deep-seated priors, core values, past memories acting as anchors, and reflexive reactions.

By cloning this submerged 95%, the AI gains the ability to simulate **human-like fluctuations and internal contradictions**, resulting in dialogue indistinguishable from the person's actual speech patterns.

## 4 Strategic Use Cases
1.  **Digitizing Tacit Knowledge:** Capturing the ineffable "intuition" and "knack" of veteran experts, converting them into digital assets for seamless technical succession.
2.  **Legacy Reconstruction:** Creating a "digital sanctuary" by faithfully replicating the thinking algorithms of loved ones, allowing for a continued sense of connection.
3.  **Digital Leader Simulation:** Simulating the decision-making patterns of visionary leaders for 24/7 strategic coaching.
4.  **High-Precision Persona Marketing:** Testing strategies against a "Cognitive Clone" of a specific target demographic to achieve unprecedented accuracy.

## Implementation: High-Fidelity at Low Cost
MET proves that creating a sophisticated cognitive clone does not require massive budgets or supercomputers. It is achieved through practical fusion:
* **Smartphone-Based Data:** Utilizing accessible, everyday communication logs.
* **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** Proprietary logic designed to translate messy, complex human data into high-resolution AI instructions.
* **Multidisciplinary Approach:** A unique synthesis of **20 years** of logical application engineering, on-the-ground operational improvement expertise, and psychological principles.
